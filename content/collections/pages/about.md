        header: 'Pepper Potts'
        content: "Pepper was formerly Tony's assistant until they started a relationship. Tony found a love for Pepper, since she was one of the few people in his life. Over the course of the film franchise, the relationship between Tony and Pepper grew but were sometimes strained because of some of the actions Tony did being Iron Man. In Iron Man 3, Pepper finally becomes Tony's girlfriend and she moves in with Tony in his house. Prior to the events of Captain America: Civil War, however, they broke up due to Tony's obsession with his Iron Man persona. They would eventually reconcile prior to the end of Spider-Man: Homecoming, with Tony proposing (off-screen) during a press conference, and they later married and had a daughter, Morgan, during the events of Avengers: Endgame.

        header: 'Howard Stark'
        content: "Tony's relationship with his father was cold and strained. Tony did not talk much with his father, as he was busy and always working. Howard was presumed to have never spent any time with his son and always made sure that Tony stayed away from his work. Tony would describe his father as \"cold and calculating\" and that he never said he loved him, and he never said he cared about him. Tony later discovered a video in which his father had admitted to loving him greatly and left him a clue to a new element derived from the Space Stone which managed to save Tony's life. Following this, Tony's opinion of his father improved somewhat, to the point that, when he went back in time to 1970 and ended up accidentally bumping into Howard during his mission, he hugged and thanked the man.
